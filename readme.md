# govCMS Composer

An alternative version of the govCMS distribution in full, which aims to be self-contained in a single composer.json file.

This serves as a personal tool made for the creator and the build process is not guarenteed to mimic the distribution exactly, nor is there a guarentee this will become or stay up to date or identical to what it is attempting to replicate.

## Getting started

The point of this project is to have an exceptionally simple installation which loads a file system into place. It does not manage virtual hosts, hosting, hosts entries or drush aliases.

### Prerequisites

* composer
* php (version which is supported by Drupal)

### Installing

```
composer install
```
